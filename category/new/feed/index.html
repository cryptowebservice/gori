<p>I teamed up with DreadXP to give you a glimpse of a brand new level; The Circus!  Yep, it&#8217;s pretty fricking awesome and the level will see us land on a prison island full of maniacal mutants and hideously horrific beasts! Each beast is completely unhinged and intent on inflicting death and destruction! So can Gori avoid the Carnival freak who will sip his toxic barrel, and spit gooey green missiles? Will I survive a tidal wave of Pop-Corns and not say F**K? (Unlikely), Will CH1-P crack a smile? (Even more unlikely!) &#8211; watch the trailer now!</p>

<p>Now, this is a story all about how<br>My life got flipped-turned upside down<br>And I&#8217;d like to take a minute<br>Just sit right there<br>I&#8217;ll tell you how I became the prince of a town called&#8230; oh, wait. Wrong story!</p>



<p>F.R.A.N.K here, my human friends! Today the mighty Angry Demon Studios (the people that actually made me) and the pretty cool folks at Wired Productions (the people that help you here about me) released the biographical Hollywood movie of the year! Yep, you can now watch a feature film all about meeeeeee! oh, and Gori plus Ch1p. Best of all, instead of casting Denzel Washington to play your loveable hoverboard, I stepped up and acted in a role that is sure to get a nod at the Oscars! Watch the maybe not feature film but 100% awesome trailer below:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class=" responsive-embed responsive-embed-16x9 embed-youtube"><iframe loading="lazy" title="Gori: Cuddly Carnage | Origins Story Trailer" width="1170" height="658" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mHebvvtft9s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Stolen straight from the propaganda press release, read below for the official blurb and all the details you&#8217;ll need to know before playing Gori: Cuddly Carnage in early 2024! If Gori could talk, I&#8217;m pretty sure he&#8217;d tell you how excited he is, but he&#8217;s a cat, so don&#8217;t get your hopes up. Oh &#8211; sign up the mailer at the bottom of this post &#8211; we maybe, probably, 1000% are working on a pretty fricking awsome new demo that you could be playing first later this year!</p>



<p><strong>CUTE OR DIE</strong></p>



<p>Humanity has been destroyed &#8211; and it&#8217;s up to Gori, along with his deadly but wise-cracking sentient hoverboard, F.R.A.N.K, and morose A.I companion, CH1-P, to slay the evil Adorable Army with lethal combos.</p>



<p>Fuelled by insatiable demand, &#8216;Cool-Toys Inc.&#8217; created &#8216;Ultra Pets&#8217;. The ultimate companions that never hunger, never require bathroom breaks and are impervious to the ravages of time. Little did anyone expect the mutation that transformed these perfect pets into twisted toys straight from your nightmares, hell-bent on wiping out humanity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Master explosive weaponry and devastating combos in an epic battle to prevent the Adorable Army from conquering the galaxy, and rescue Professor Y, their missing creator and only human who showed Gori and his friends love. Push your combat and platforming skills to the limits as you fight your way through twisted landscapes filled with environmental hazards, razor-sharp adult humour and a bone-crunching, pulse-pounding soundtrack.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Congratulations Gori Demo Players! Together you have managed to sever 5,121,625 unicorn limbs during your playthroughs of the demo! You crazy people!     </p>



<p>To celebrate this spectacularly violent achievement (and commiserate with the one unicorn who apparently lost a single limb at the time of counting) a brand new trailer was revealed during Fear Fest – showcasing some of the bloody ‘glory kills’, and boss encounters from the early stages of the game. As well as showcasing Gori’s unique blend of adorably twisted creations and visceral combat – the trailer also revealed the <strong>‘Day One’ cosmetic skins</strong> available for Gori and F.R.A.N.K as a thank you to those who wishlist the game and pick up the game during the launch period.</p>
