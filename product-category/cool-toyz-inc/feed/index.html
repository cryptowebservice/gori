										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gori is the first prototype of the “Ultra-Pet” but wasn’t approved by Cool-Toys since Gori wasn’t cute and pliable enough. Gori, as the original pet that he is, is unable to speak human language and is limited in his communication to cute meowing. A feature he isn’t very fond of since he hates being cute…</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">F.R.A.N.K is your sentient and razor-sharp hoverboard. A prototype of a hoverboard that also extends knives made to cut cardboard targets, the AI was “too much” and because of the problem with the knives the AI was never re-made.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CH1-P is a modular AI that will constantly complain as you wipe out hordes of corrupted cuddly toys. CH1-P was an AI module inserted into different Cool-Toyz products. This early prototype was too self aware and “sad”. Not approved for production CH1-P stayed Dr. Y’s private collection.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Doll House is a single-eyed house-like creature. It spawns baby dolls and it has a poisonous sting. Baby dolls from the doll house can target the Gori and perform their attacks. The poisonous sting is a root-like part with an eye. It will follow underground and sting Gori.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baby Dolls are flying baby doll heads with a single laser attack from its right eye. Occasionally, the Baby Doll will shoot a fireball to the ground, then spew up its brain, dangling from the head. At this time, the player can slice the cord from the brain and kill the Baby Doll. The laser and the fireball both deal huge damage to Gori.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These enemies require the Slam Wheel ability to be able to destroy them. Gori must get above them and Slam Wheel their power button to cause them to explode. </span><b>Primary Attack: Electric attack</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; When the player is struck by an electrical field they are no longer able to attack. Gori must heal from this by mashing ‘X’ to recover his abilities.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cutest companion, until they get infected with Mother’s Gift and become the ravenous uglycorn. Before their infection, the Unicorns were the cutest and most popular Ultra Pets toys on the market, deeply adored by all who saw them. Their ever-growing popularity played a huge part in the serial abandonment of other Ultra Pet toys, fuelling the rage behind the Adorable Army’s quest for human demise.</span></p>
